# dumb
I find myself reading a lot of lyrics while listening to my favorite songs, my go-to place for this is Genius since you can find pretty much everything there, if not you can just create it :D.  
My only issue with the platform is their over 4MB of trackers, analytics and junk which has nothing to do with the actual lyrics.
Thus I created this alternative front-end so I can read song lyrics with ease and as lightweight as possible.
